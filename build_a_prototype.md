# Build a Prototype - Week 2

Now it is time to start coding. This is a one-week sprint. The goal is to build a basic stripped-down app with only the core features working.

###Make a plan
Divide responsibilities. How you do this is up to you. Some suggestions include

- Have some people work on the visual design: wireframes and HTML/CSS
- Have others focus on the javascript. Create the necessary objects and functions.
- Then work together to 'wire' the javascript to the page.
- Check in often to avoid double-work or contradictory work.
- The teams are big. Work in Pairs!

### The importance of good names
When working as a team, take the time to choose accurate and clear names for the variables, objects, methods, classes, ids, styles, etc that you will be creating.


- Use descriptive names. `ShoppingCart` is much better than `data`. `addItemToCart` is better than `add`.
- It is ok to take the time to write out longer names if it is going to save time later when other are tying to understand the code.
- Write code that is friendly for others to read.

###"Move fast and break things"
This was the founding motto at Facebook. What you are building does not have users yet, so don't worry about being perfect. During this prototype phase you should:
- Prioritize functionality over 'looks'.
- Don't spend too much time trying to fix minor errors.
- Focus on getting the core parts working, even if it is a bit messy.

The time for pixel-perfect design and flawless features will come later. You only have a week to build so go!
