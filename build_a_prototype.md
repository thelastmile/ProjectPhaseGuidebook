# Build a Prototype

Now it is time to start coding. This is a one-week sprint. The goal is to build a basic stripped-down app with the core features implmented. 

###Review
In building the prototype, you will find answers to questions such as;

- Did we choose the right set of features for this app?
- Is our technical plan going to work?

Use your prototype to test out the feasibility of the full-fledged app you are planning to build. Then ask yourselves how you can do it better.

- How can we our design be more clear and easy-to-use?
- How can our code be more simple and reliable?

###Refactor

Reorganizing code to make it simple and easy-to-use is a task best done after attempting a first-pass. Now that we have a working prototype, let's reconsider our objects, functions and general organization to find ways to approach the task more efficiently.
