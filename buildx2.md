# Release

## Quality Assurance

It is very hard to inspect your own work for bugs. Quality Assurance work, aka QA, must be done by someone *other* than the primary author of the project. 

Be thorough. Follow every possible user path through the app, to 'break' it as you go.

Take careful notes of the issues you find and present them to the team to review and prioritize what should be fixed first.  


# Ship it

Most app creators make the mistake of waiting too long before releasing their first version. Don't do this. Start putting potential users in front of your product as early as possible. Their reactions to your work are the stars of the constellation you navigate by. Listen to the users and you won't get lost.
