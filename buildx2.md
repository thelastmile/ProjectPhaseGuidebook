# Buildx2

Now its time to build the app that will be the final product. Take what you've learned from the prototype and get ready to spend the next two weeks building the real deal.

###Roadmap version 2
Take into account everything you think you need to do between now and the project due date. Prioritize the most important tasks first. Don't save the hardest part for the end. Be clear on what features you will cancel first if time starts to run out. 

###Feature Freeze
At the end of the second build week, we are going to declare a 'feature freeze'. This means that no new features will be added. The following week will focus on Quality Assuarance (QA) to fix the bugs in time for Demo Day.
