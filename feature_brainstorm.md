# Feature Brainstorm

Review the pitchdeck for your business. Consider the business to be the 'client' that has employed you to build a website (aka 'app'). What is the best app that you can build for this business in six weeks?

As a team, answer the following questions about your project:

1. Who is the intended audience?
2. How can this app best support the business?
3. What will bring users to use this app?


### Discuss and write user stories


User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a (type of user), I want (some goal) so that (some reason).

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.
