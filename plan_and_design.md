# Plan and Design

The key to building significant web applications in a timely manner is to plan, plan, plan! Do not start writing any code until you have a solid idea of what it is you are going to build. 

### Prioritize Features

Collect your user stories and decide which are features are core to the business. Break down your plans into distinct features. Discuss the technical complexity of each features. Is this going to be easy for the team? Do you feel confident that you can build this with the help of your mentors?

### Draft Design
Make wireframes that illustrate the steps a user will take in each of the core user-stories you wrote. How will the user navigate through your app? Be sure to wireframe the UI *and* the UX of your app.

### Draft Technical Specs
What tools are you going to use? What data objects will you need to create (shopping cart?, person?). Map out your key data objects and their properties. What functions are you going to need? Be sure to discuss the code before you write it!

### Product Roadmap

Create a plan for how you are going to construct this app. Try and tackle the hard parts early on. If you are unsure if a technical implementation is going to work, try it out right away to avoid getting stuck later.
