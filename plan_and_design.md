# Plan and Design

The key to building significant web applications in a timely manner is to plan, plan, plan! Do not start writing any code until you have a solid idea of what it is you are going to build. 

### Prioritize Features

Collect your user stories and decide which are features are core to the business. Break down your plans into distinct features. Discuss the technical complexity of each features. Is this going to be easy for the team? Do you feel confident that you can build this with the help of your mentors?

### Product Roadmap

Create a plan for how you are going to construct this app. Try and tackle the hard parts early on. If you are unsure if a technical implementation is going to work, try it out right away to avoid getting stuck later.
