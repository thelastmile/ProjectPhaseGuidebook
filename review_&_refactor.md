# Review & Refactor - Week 3

Congrats on building your prototype. It is now time to take stock of what we've done so far and decide how to proceed. First, do some user tests.

###User testing
Have people not on your team sit down and try to use your app. Don't instruct them in any way. Just watch while they try to figure it out on their own. 
- Ask the tester lots of questions.
- Have them explain their thought process out loud.
- Take notes on where they are most confused.

Do this several times. The more testers the better. Then, collect your notes and identify the key themes from the user-tests.

### Review
Looking over your prototype, ask yourselves as a team:

1. Did we choose the best features to focus on?
2. Did our technical approach work? 
3. Is our design clear and easy-to-use?

Identify what features may prove too complicated to build. Either come up with a simpler way to build the feature, or scrap it. 

###Refactor

Start with the feedback from user testing. What most needs to change about your app? Refactoring is the process of taking an existing project and revising it. You will need to refactor both the visual design and the code behind it.

- Start with the design first. Improve the UX and UI as best you can with the feedback you're received from your testers (and mentors).
- Then, revise your code to make it more simple and efficient. How can your Javascript methods and objects be rewritten to better align with the business logic of the app? 
- Take some time to rewrite the most tangled and messy parts of the codebase, whether its HTML, CSS or Javascript.
